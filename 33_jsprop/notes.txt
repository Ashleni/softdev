JS Bubble and Squeak

Order of the bubbles depends on the structure of the DOM.
For addEventListener, when the boolean is true, the bubbles are performed from 
the outermost "bubble" in the DOM, which in our .html file is <table>, then <tr>, then <td>
But when this boolean value is false, the bubbles are in reverse order from <td>, <tr>, then <table>.

e.stopPropagation() prevents bubbling further after the first event is performed.
